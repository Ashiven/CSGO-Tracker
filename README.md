# CapsuleScraper
A simple tool to keep track of specific CSGO item prices.
OutputToPlot.py will create a price chart using data accumulated over time in output.csv .
Note that for this to work the Eur prices have to be on even numbered lines and the dollar prices on uneven numbered lines.
This should be the case by default but it might be a cause for errors.
