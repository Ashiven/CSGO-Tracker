# CapsuleScraper
A simple tool to keep track of specific CSGO item prices.
OutputToPlot.py will create a price chart using data accumulated over time in output.csv .
Note that for this to work the euro prices have to be on evenly-numbered lines and the dollar prices on unevenly-numbered lines.
This should be the case by default but it might be a cause for errors.
